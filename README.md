# Rochambeau (Rock-Paper-Scissors)

A fun, animated command-line version of the classic game Rock-Paper-Scissors (also known as Rochambeau), written in Python.

## What is Rochambeau?
Rochambeau, or Rock-Paper-Scissors, is a simple hand game usually played between two people. Each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with their hand:
- Rock
- Paper
- Scissors

The winner is determined by the rules:
- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
- Paper beats Rock

## How to Play
1. Run the script using Python 3:
   ```
   python rochambeau.py
   ```
2. Follow the on-screen prompts:
   - Choose your move by typing the full name (e.g., `rock`), a single letter (`r`, `p`, `s`), or the number (`1`, `2`, `3`).
   - You can also exit the game by typing `4`, `e`, `q`, `x`, `exit`, or `quit`.
3. Watch the animated countdown and see your move and the computer's move displayed side by side with ASCII art.
4. The game will announce the winner of each round and keep score.
5. Play as many rounds as you like! The score table updates after each round.
